Project Title: Find a Blood Donor

Problem Statement/Opportunity: <br>
Blood Donations in India are conducted by organizations and hospitals through blood donation camps. Donors can also visit blood banks in hospitals to donate blood. Despite a huge population, the demand-supply gap for blood units persists in many healthcare facilities in the country. Not all the time patients get blood from blood banks. Patients who have diseases like cancer which requires a blood transfusion once every 3 to 6 months, are always rejected to get blood from blood banks. Presently there are no applications that can connect donors directly to blood recipients. This project aims to create a web-based system that has the ability to avoid intermediaries and connects donors directly to the recipient. It also offers an effective solution where connect blood donors with recipients, without any intermediary such as banks, for an efficient and seamless process.

Project Description: <br>
According to a 2012 report by the World Health Organisation, only 9 million blood units are available annually, whereas the demand is 12 million units. There is a problem with the availability of needed blood types. Not all the time patients get blood from blood banks. Patients who have diseases like cancer which requires a blood transfusion once every 3 to 6 months, are always rejected to get blood from blood banks. So, when a person needs a certain blood group that is not available in the hospital, family members send messages through social media to those who can donate to them and this process takes longer and leaves the patientâ€™s life in danger. Despite advances in technology, today's blood bank systems are running in a manual system. Besides this, it seems that there is a lack of proper documentation about donors. Also, blood in banks contaminates which becomes useless to patients. Although a few blood banks have their blood bank management system, still they cannot provide a facility to connect donors directly to recipients. This project aims to create a web-based system that has the ability to avoid intermediaries and connects donors directly to the recipient. It also offers an effective solution where connect blood donors with recipients, without any intermediary such as banks, for an efficient and seamless process.
